Domains can be blocked for a variety of reasons. Sometimes it's for tracking, a phishing attack, spamming their customers via email and lots more.
<p>
But also sometimes, you don't care, because you need to use a certain service. That's where the Anti-Blocklisten come into play. 
  Import these as Whitelists. These Anti-Blocklists will make sure your service works. Reguardless that our or any 
  other blocklist on the Internet blocks it.
